# How to contribute

Big news: standards change (some more often than others). 

Standards are continuously influenced by technological evolution (e.g. framework upgrade) and business constraints (e.g. laws, regulations). 

Ensuring the guidelines are up-to-date is a shared responsibility and will benefit everyone. 

Feel free to contribute and engage people in these discussions.

## Advices

When defining an existing standard or working on an ADR, consider the following aspects:
- providing concrete examples and/or POCs will help visualise the pros/cons of each options. 
- upgrading the application templates or shared modules accordingly will allow progressive integration with new applications
- giving guidelines for migrating existing systems (from "do-not-migrate guidelines" to "step-by-step guidelines") will help reduce tech debt. 
- ensuring that you propose self-service features so you do not become a bottleneck yourself
