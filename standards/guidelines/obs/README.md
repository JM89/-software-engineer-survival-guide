# Observability Standards

## Goals

- Detect and resolve problems quickly and limit the impact (e.g. client impact, data inconsistency)
- Be able to take meaningful strategic decisions based on measures (e.g. metrics, meanful errors) and focus on the right improvements

## Scope

In scope:
- Application Logging/Metrics/Tracing 
- Server Logging/Metrics
- Other Cloud Service Logging/Metrics/Tracing

Out of scope:
- Data Observability (via dedicated big data tools)

## Solution Overview

*TODO: Short description of the techs/tools used. If applicable, mention about its known limitations.*

Sub-sections:
- [Logging](./logging/README.md)
- [Metrics](./metrics/README.md)
- [Tracing](./tracing/README.md)
