# Application Lifecycle Management Shared Ownership

## Goals

- improve ownership and accountability of all the stages of development: from business requirements to delivery
- avoid team silos which would eventually slow down delivery
- help open-mindness by taking a different perspective to the same problem
- give engineers the opportunity to learn different but complementary skills
- benefits from all engineer personal experience on given problems/contexts

## Scope

In scope:
- Active participation to business requirement, system design and planning work
- Configure the pipeline & infrastructure components (via code)
- Strategic thinking/pragmatism during the development of tasks
- Write the documentation based on the standards
- Develop the automated tests
- Deliver the product & monitor

Out of scope:
- [Streamlining New Project Creation](../streamlining/README.md)

## Solution Overview

To get started, check the following guides:
- [Continuous Integration](../ci/README.md)
- [Continuous Delivery](../cdelivery/README.md)
- [Pipeline As Code](../pac/README.md)
- [Infrastructure As Code](../iac/README.md)
- [Application Standards](../iac/README.md)

Best practices checklist:
* Identify team bottlenecks and participate to solving issues (e.g. adoption of DevOps mindset)
* Keep changes small and clean. Use feature flags. Externalise reusable code.
* What applies to application code, often applies to IaC too. 
* Try to figure out things by yourself first (but do not let yourself blocked for too long)
* Make sure your code works in Test environment(s) 
* Report improvements on existing code base (when applicable)
